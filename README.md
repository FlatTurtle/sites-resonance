FlatTurtle sites

Installation
------------

*This repository is a copy of the Laravel framework with minor modifications. The Laravel framework requires PHP >= 5.3.7 and the MCrypt PHP extension.*

Clone this repository and install the Laravel framework and other dependencies:

	composer install

Make sure the folders in `app/storage` are writable.

The `composer install` command will automatically trigger the `php artisan flatturtle:update` which will execute `php artisan flatturtle:install` for new clones. This command publishes the **SiteCore** configuration files and assets to your local installation.

Updating Sitecore
-----------------

To update the **SiteCore** to the latest version run:

	composer update flatturtle/sitecore

This will pull the latest changes from the git repository. It will automatically trigger the `php artisan flatturtle:update` command that publishes assets to your local installation.

Also, double check if the configuration file was modified and change your local version accordingly. You can overwrite your local configuration file with the latest version by using the `php artisan flatturtle:install` command.

### Deploy best practices

The `composer.lock` file contains the exact version numbers of the dependancies used during the last `composer update`. You should **NEVER** execute `composer update` on a production environment. The correct workflow is to execute `composer update` on your workstation, check for any errors and then commit the `composer.lock` file to your git repository. Once the production environment is updated with the latest lock-file, you can execute `composer install`, which will install the dependancies based on the lock-file.

Configuration
-------------

After installing the **SiteCore** there will be a configuration **and password** file located in `app/config/packages/flatturtle/sitecore`. Make sure you set a valid password for the following services in `passwords.php`:

	'reservations' => '...'

**WARNING!** The password file is ignored by git, so deploy it manually.

Templating
----------

The **SiteCore** contains a default template file. If you wish to modify this template execute the following:

	php artisan view:publish flatturtle/sitecore

This will copy the template file to `app/views/flatturtle/sitecore` so that you can modify it.

Style
-----

The template includes http://getbootstrap.com and http://fontawesome.io. You can also use these additional styles:

 - `.colorful`: add the branding color as background color.
 - `.highlight`: add the branding color as font color.
 - `.center`: center align text.
 - `h1.big`: a bigger h1 header.

Carousel
--------

All images placed in the `public/carousel` folder will automatically be used for the carousel.

Content
-------

The `content` folder contains the site's content. You can include markdown (.md) and HTML (.html) files. Markdown files will be parsed using parsedown.org.

You can order your site's content by adding numbers in front of the file name:

	01-first_block.md
	02-second_block.html

Commands
--------

These are the included artisan commands:

### flatturtle:install

Used when installing the **SiteCore** for the first time. This will:

 - Publish the configuration file to `app/config/packages/flatturtle/sitecore/config.php`
 - Publish assets to `public/packages/flatturtle/sitecore`
 - Generate a Laravel application key
 - Clear application cache
 - Create the content directory if it does not exists
